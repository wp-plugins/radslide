A javascript slideshow plugin that supports multiple slideshows and uses jQuery Cycle.

== Description ==

radSLIDE creates a simple interface for updating a javascript slideshow based on jQuery Cycle.

radSLIDE was developed by RadicalDesigns as a way to make updating a javascript jQuery based slideshow easy for non-technical users. 

Setup and customization of the display may require a knowledge of HTML and CSS. A working knowledge of the amazing jQuery cycle plugin, which it depends on, is also helpful.
